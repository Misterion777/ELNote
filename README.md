# ELNote
Eli Lasy Note is extremely cool, nice and fast notation program
(Actually it's just a course work for BSUIR yet full of bugs)

Implemented functionality:
1. Composition can be created in all possible keys.
2. Any note of 4th and 5th octave can be added to melody.
3. Any random chord can be added to harmony.
4. Any unit of melody/harmony can be edited/deleted.
5. Composition can be saved (binary serialization) to a (.mm) file and then loaded(deserialization)
