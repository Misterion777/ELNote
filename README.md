# ELNote
Eli Lasy Note is extremely cool, nice and fast notation program!
(actually it's just a lab work for BSUIR yet full of bugs)

Implemented functionality:
* Composition can be created in all possible keys.
* Any note of 4th and 5th octave can be added to melody.
* Any random chord can be added to harmony.
* Any unit of melody/harmony can be edited/deleted.
* Composition can be saved (binary serialization) to a (.mm) file and then loaded (deserialization).
